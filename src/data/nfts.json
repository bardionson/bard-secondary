A reconfiguration of materials into chips and screens and laser beams to simulate a different sort of reality. A so called place in a digital mirage. A place were a human can abstract themselves into a single line or the shape of a fly. We will morph into different skins perhaps every second. Dynamically generatively making a new vision of our identity. This art illustrates a communication between entities through a digital fashion. A new symbology of avatars. Some of which are simulated beings created from artificial intelligence trained on specific cannons of work to represent knowledge from particular studies or important bodies of work by important scholars or artists. The curatorial choices we make can determine our virtual skin.",

But yet we have not heard the earth speak and it is under threat. We are linked in body and mind with this consciousness and must preserve it to save ourselves. \n\nWe travel from LA, Anaheim, Santa Monica, Bakersfield, Monterey Bay, Watsonville, Santa Cruz, Point Reyes, Guerneville, Mountain View and San Francisco taking pictures all along the way. A family trip gathering the vision and vibes of California. The roads, deserts, fields of artichokes, strawberries, chickpeas and vineyards of grapes, the ocean, wild life and the trees o the trees. The great redwoods. Over 3,000 images feed the model. The abundance of open space and nature has eliminated human made objects and people from the model despite the abundance of vehicles photographed. \n\nPhotography by Bard, Jennifer and Liza Grace. Model constructed with StyleGAN2 from 2,000 photographs. Output has been selected and manipulated by the artist.",

The essence of a flame is captured in its primal state, its motion frozen yet embodying the fierce dance of fire's embrace. The luminous heart at the center is a beacon, an anchor of brightness in the fluid chaos of its surroundings.\nChanneling the fire myths of the world, Prometheus, the Phoenix, the gods of the sun and flame. A story of technology brought to humans; to myths of destruction and rebirth. To be immortal; to be a god; it is always a paradox of fire and technology. The morality of the fire is always in question but we desire it and fear it. And yet it has changed us, we have learned so much since we first touched fire. We used it to destroy the wood, smelt the metal and build the chip. And now we teach and show the fire what we know; what we create and our reflection is there telling us our faults.

        "description": "Fountain but with graffiti on the bathroom walls.\n\nWord Flush is a new work adding words to “The Fountain” as commentary on the art, feelings of the artist, and the culture of the day. It is based on The Fountain curated image from a StyleGAN 2 Ai model created and trained by artist Bård Ionson. Created from images of toilets but sometimes mixed with crucifix, gas masks and clocks. An experiment in modern conceptual art with performance from artists of all mediums. The entire model and performance around it are the art.\n\nOriginally conceived as a free to remix project, artists have recreated some of the Fountains in their own way. I too am renewing the spirit of Fountain with this remix. This new work is a reaction to the original company who created the Fountain contract going out of business and turning off the API metadata server. The first owners of these tokens will be the holders of the original Fountain tokens at the time the artist is able to airdrop them.\n\nFind more detail at https://fountain-art.com\n\nOriginal contract for the parent of Word Flush is Fountain (FOUNT) at:\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x3ac9ef13007e2f8ad860a77f5fdf14696acf1e02\n\nOriginal images from Fountain are found at:\nipfs://bafybeidf5bi2va47iogirpxyhj6737vyabuommev63oc2gl3u6cgb5ltwe\n\nRemix License: https://bardionson.com/remixLicense1.html\n\nThe Fountain model was trained by the artist who has spent time curating 2,700 images of toilets. Bård then generated thousands of images doing a quick curation for the ones worthy of display.\n\nWhy toliets? The artist was inspired by the story of the artwork called Fountain. The piece is not really much to see. It is the idea and the people behind it that are of interest. The unending argument over what is art and who is allowed to make it.  It has been theorized that the real artist behind Fountain, the R. Mutt urinal by Marcel Duchamp was really conceived of by Elsa von Freytag-Loinghoven. She collaborated on another conceptual artwork however called God.

It is based on The Fountain curated image from a StyleGAN 2 Ai model created and trained by artist Bård Ionson. Created from images of toilets but sometimes mixed with crucifix, gas masks and clocks. An experiment in modern conceptual art with performance from artists of all mediums. The entire model and performance around it are the art.\n\nOriginally conceived as a free to remix project, artists have recreated some of the Fountains in their own way. I too am renewing the spirit of Fountain with this remix. This new work is a reaction to the original company who created the Fountain contract going out of business and turning off the API metadata server.

        "description": "A SPAM performance in virtual reality. A meme of meaning, an energy source preserved in a packable stackable can to fight a war or two or three. The countries where SPAM performed became fused with their cultural cuisine. \n\nUpload the video to a platform that supports 360 video or to your VR Goggles and enjoy the performance and listen to that slurp as it slides out of the can.\n\nA hand with a gold ring reaches down and holds a can of SPAM. A can with its distinctive gold can with blue label with the word SPAM in bold yellow.  With a second hand the artist pulls the ring tap slowly upwards. The hand grabs the can. An old CRT TV rests in the background. The can moves upward and upside down. The hand shakes the can again and again. Now the performance goes into slow motion. The edge of the can is seen at the top of the screen.The slab of SPAM slowly slides out, growing larger with its fall to the plate. It bounces slightly on the beige plate.",

        "description": "My earliest memory of an excavator is from our summer cabin with\nmy father is next to me as I am in the sandbox playing with a green metal toy excavator, which was just a mechanical digging arm with a seat on it. You would operate it by pushing and pulling on the handles you were holding on to. I remember the joy of discovering how it worked after the initial struggle, and how satisfying it was just to dig and move the sand around.\nMuch later in art school, I started doing ink drawing between painting sessions. I did a little bit of it in my teens when I was enthusiastic about making comics, though without much patience for it. And then, few years after my graduation I would pick the pens again, with more definite goals.\nI was often drawing just random things in my sketchbooks. I did not think much of them then. They were an excuse for the line as I wrote on a notebook once. I was trying to learn the medium. It was awkward first. I had wrong kind of paper, and the ink would splatter as the nibs scratched the paper. Then again, I cherished it and often abused my pens on purpose creating a big mess.\nLooking back, I see frustration of all kinds. I remember that my eyes got very tired quickly from drawing. I was not very good with expressing myself with words and especially dreaded writing, It is all in there.\nAt some point the excavators started to appear. I found them fascinating to look at, If saw one on a construction on my way to college. They reminded me of some ancient dinosaur, perhaps because of association from the Flintstones cartoon. I still stop to admire them sometimes. \nThe drawings were not trying to be actual representations of the machinery, though I did study them a little bit. The excavators were turning out to become a part of a system of symbols, same as with the repeating letter “a”, I was drawing with something of a built obsession as method to discover meaning with absurdity.\nThe idea began with the launch of the 24h feature on AsyncArt. It has changed a lot since, but it was always going to be something with excavators. \nSome of the watercolor works were made for this piece in particular. Though I forgot about them for a while until finding them in box stored away. Some are old ones all the way from my first exhibition. I put them all together and arranged them randomly. The runes I painted myself just for fun, let’s say, not intended to be used in art. As the time arose, I felt compelled to use them. I cast them randomly for each picture, as a symbolic gesture. The runes can be representing many things, from actual letters to wisdom and magic. There are many things we can see but don’t understand and then ignore until we learn their meaning, like words of a foreign language. \nThe old drawings from my sketchbooks were placed on the image transparently showing the inverted colors of what is below. I still feel ashamed about a lot of them, the silly puns and visual jokes, mundane scribbles, desires, and struggles contained within the pages, but it was necessary to the turn the ground for this work. Some of it I can appreciate more now and feel proud of things that I have made progress with.\nThis makes me think of history and archaeology. the act in time, digging in the present to gain knowledge of our past and creating it for the future, while we are constantly producing new material to be dug up later.\nThe feel for material is very important to me. whether digital or traditional, it takes time to get acquainted with it. With this piece my material is beyond the changing images and the technology making it possible - it is almost as if it is time itself that I am digging away.\n\nDig Boy Dig\nMikko Lyytinen \n2023",

In so doing, their feather colours would change in colour. Sometimes to white. Sometimes to green. Sometimes to sparkling gold.\n\nThis NFT changes how it looks based on the time of day.

        "description": "Don Quixote: Windmills of My Childhood by Hulki Okan Tabak, minted 1/1 on Async Art, 2022\n\n2 artworks in a daily cycle..\n\n...\n\nDon Quixote project is a highly personal interpretation of the hero and his world. Various photographic and AI tools are used to create, manipulate and recreate the images. The story will be numbered for all of us to track down what we hold essentially. Beyond ease of use, the numbers are not sequential. Each image is independent but some images will be interdependent parts of smaller stories which I will mention. I would also mint some editions outside of Manifold. Note that editions of this project could be 1/1s or multi editions. The mints on Async Art will not be numbered as they each contain multiple images in themselves.\n\n...\n\nDon Quixote is a Spanish epic novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, its full title is The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.\n\nA founding work of Western literature, it is often labeled as the first modern novel and one of the greatest ever written. Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated books in the world.\n\nWhen first published, Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel. After the French Revolution, it was better known for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and was seen as a story of disenchantment. In the 19th century, it was seen as social commentary, but no one could easily tell \"whose side Cervantes was on\". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality.

Some call them demons, monsters and zombies while I would prefer more neutral terms but nonetheless here are some of the photographs I've taken of them which I release with full disclosure and their cooperation. The prospective collectors should acknowledge the existence of \"undead\" and some even more exotic characters might cause some alarm among the general population. Therefore viewer caution is warranted even though most of these peoples I met during the NFT Summit seemed to be of absolutely good character (not sure about some demonic entities that did not respond) and interested in art and its manifestation with the technologies branded aptly as NFT and what not.",

Various photographic and AI tools are used to create, manipulate and recreate the images. The story will be numbered for all of us to track down what we hold essentially. Beyond ease of use, the numbers are not sequential. Each image is independent but some images will be interdependent parts of smaller stories which I will mention. I would also mint some editions outside of Manifold. Note that editions of this project could be 1/1s or multi editions. The mints on Async Art will not be numbered as they each contain multiple images in themselves.\n\n...\n\nDon Quixote is a Spanish epic novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, its full title is The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.\n\nA founding work of Western literature, it is often labeled as the first modern novel and one of the greatest ever written. Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated books in the world.\n\nWhen first published, Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel. After the French Revolution, it was better known for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and was seen as a story of disenchantment. In the 19th century, it was seen as social commentary, but no one could easily tell \"whose side Cervantes was on\". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature and a formidable example of what letters can do. (wikipedia)",
