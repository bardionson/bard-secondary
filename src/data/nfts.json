Block by block, the balance between \"sending\" and \"receiving\" across all tokens determines what each piece displays. As collectors change their settings, the entire network shifts in real time.\n\nCollectors begin by creating a 64×64 pixel character, a personal sprite, to represent themselves on the network. Optionally, they can compose a simple four-track audio tune to accompany their sprite. This can be done through the Art Blocks interface, which records and submits the creation directly to the blockchain, or through the fully on-chain editors embedded in the artwork itself, allowing collectors to generate a data string and manually update their token via Etherscan.\n\nBy default, each token starts in a neutral state. If a sprite has been added, the artwork displays it as a static image. From there, collectors choose how they want to participate: send, receive, or both.\n\nThese choices shape the global system. When more tokens are sending, the receiving tokens display incoming sprites more rapidly. When more tokens choose to receive, the senders are distributed across the network at a slower pace. Each token expresses its role visually:\n* Receive mode: a continuous flow of incoming sprites, presented in one of four styles assigned at mint (grid, column, fall, or bounce).\n* Send mode: your sprite remains centered, occasionally pulsing outward as it broadcasts.\n* Send + Receive: your token displays its receive style with a subtle pulsing border to indicate that it is also sending.\n\nCollectors are invited to adjust their token's setting as their mood changes to give, to take, or to hold both impulses at once.

As someone who is not religious, I wanted to explore the underlying sentiment without invoking prayer directly to create a way for us to express care, attention, and presence through the medium of networked art.\n\nEmpathy is the foundation of this work. In a world that increasingly questions its value, I believe empathy is essential not only for navigating our digital lives, but for understanding each other at all. Taking a moment to step into someone else's shoes can illuminate motivations, reduce friction, and help us meet each other with generosity. send/receive is an experiment in using on-chain art to make that exchange visible, felt, and shared.\n",

It was trained and generated from a Stable Diffusion LoRA model composed of photography of animal bones.   It fits into the simulation stage of representation. This art has more realistic twin that was captured on analog film called \"Sky Face\" and \"Unholy Skull Of God\".\n\n\"Bones: Vanishing of the Genuine\" explores the beauty of bone and sky in life, death and simulation using analog film photography and AI as inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe's bones in the New Mexico sky and Jean Baudrillard's concept of hyperreality.  \n\nBård examines the authenticity of artifacts by juxtaposing bones, their photographs and AI generated images, questioning the transition from reality to symbol to simulation to simulacra.  Through the stages of an AI simulation and process a new reality is constructed. \n\nProcess\n\nThe process to create Bones was to gather animal bones from ethical suppliers, but one key deer skull was found on the side of the road.  These bones were photographed with analog film cameras against the backdrop of the sky. The developed film was scanned and Photoshop was used to remove the filament holding the bone up.  The photos were used to train multiple GAN and Stable diffusion models. \n\nThe process illustrates the progression of the real bone into a physical representation on film, then digitized into more symbolic systems. The model training turned the images of the bones into a simulation that can recreate any sort of bone and the background of the sky.  A final stage for a rare few tokens was to image the digital Ai image back onto analog film.

        "description": "In the sky forms appear, a flag of cloud turns to bone. Modern simulation hyperreality where the temporal is made eternal in the model of artificial intelligence. In this new culture we question what is real and what is simulated.\n\n\"Bone, Cloud, Flag\" is a simulation of a model of film and digital photos of deer, springbok, blesbok, pig and cow bones with sky, night and flags in the background.  It was trained and generated from a StyleGAN 2 model using film and digital photographs taken by the artist.\n\n\"Vanishing of the Genuine\" explores the beauty of bone and sky in life, death and simulation using analog film photography and AI as inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe's bones in the New Mexico sky and Jean Baudrillard's concept of hyperreality.  \n\nThe beauty of the bone floating in the sky with clouds and trees exposes the human perception of the world and the alterations of technology in the form of artificial intelligence. But these bones and the Ai model hold the promise of immortality, the bone outlasts death and perhaps we hope the simulation / simulacra of our creation will also be immortal. \n\nBård examines the authenticity of artifacts by juxtaposing bones, their photographs and AI generated images, questioning the transition from reality to symbol to simulation to simulacra.  Through the stages of an AI simulation and process a new reality is constructed. \n\nProcess\n\nThe process to create Bones was to gather animal bones from ethical suppliers, but one key deer skull was found on the side of the road.  These bones were photographed with analog film cameras against the backdrop of the sky. The developed film was scanned and Photoshop was used to remove the filament holding the bone up.  The photos were used to train multiple GAN and Stable diffusion models. \n\nThe process illustrates the progression of the real bone into a physical representation on film, then digitized into more symbolic systems. The model training turned the images of the bones into a simulation that can recreate any sort of bone and the background of the sky. \n\nIt is of note that the models were not completely trained on film photos.

For two months, beginning March 17, the standalone installation transforms the concept of digital materiality through an ever-shifting botanical ecosystem on blockchain where no single moment repeats itself. Herzog's new work employs blockchain affordances as a creative medium, building a space where collectors become active participants in the cultivation of living digital flora - works conceived collectively through a smart contract. Each element exists in a state of perpetual evolution, responding to temporal conditions including diurnal cycles and seasonal progressions.\nFlowers can be minted through Shape. They may be combined, creating personal arrangements in one’s garden that evolve over time. Flowers can be gifted to other collectors and merged to a new garden. OpenSea facilitates the acquisition of flowers on secondary needed to diversify existing gardens.\nInfinite Garden invites the audience to root for blockchain not merely as a transactional framework but as an expressive medium with distinct properties for generative art. Presented in partnership with Shape, and supported by OpenSea. 50% of the proceeds are donated to Protocol Guild, a collective funding mechanism for Ethereum core protocol maintainers.",

This token acts as a mint-to-redeem mechanism—holders who mint it will be eligible to claim the zine, a collectible artifact of Black excellence and creativity.\n\n16:9 – Black History & Innovation Edition\n\nIn celebration of Black History Month, this special edition of the 16:9 digital zine preserves culture on-chain, spotlighting African American innovation and global influence. As a mint-to-redeem mechanism, this NFT serves as the gateway to claiming an exclusive zine—an artifact that honours Black excellence, creativity, and the indelible mark left on history and the future.\n\nPreserving Culture On-Chain\n\nThe blockchain is more than a technology; it’s a ledger of truth, a space where history can be recorded, owned, and passed down without alteration. In the spirit of preservation, 16:9 – Black History & Innovation Edition ensures that the contributions of Black visionaries—past, present, and future—remain documented, immutable, and accessible. This edition captures the essence of African American ingenuity across various disciplines, from science and technology to music, literature, and the arts.\n\nBy leveraging blockchain’s permanence, we are reclaiming the narrative, ensuring that Black stories are remembered and owned by those who engage with and contribute to them. The zine itself exists as a collectable artifact, marking a new way to experience and archive culture in a decentralised world.\n\nInnovation & Influence\n\nBlack history is a history of innovation. From the scientific breakthroughs of George Washington Carver and Katherine Johnson to the artistic revolutions led by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Octavia Butler, African American ingenuity has shaped global culture in profound ways. Hip-hop, jazz, and rock & roll—genres birthed from Black communities—continue to define music worldwide. Fashion, film, and literature shaped by Black creators influence industries on a global scale.\n\nThis edition of 16:9 curates a selection of these groundbreaking moments, paying homage to those who have pushed boundaries, rewritten rules, and built legacies despite systemic barriers. It also recognizes the modern-day innovators—technologists, digital artists, and cultural curators—who continue to shape the future.\n\nThe Mint-to-Redeem Mechanism\n\n16:9 – Black History & Innovation Edition introduces a unique mint-to-redeem experience. By minting this token, holders gain eligibility to claim the digital zine, securing a piece of history on-chain. This mechanism not only reinforces the collectible nature of the zine but also offers an interactive way to engage with cultural preservation in Web3.\n\nRather than simply consuming content, minters become part of a decentralized archival process, contributing to the movement of Black storytelling in the digital space. The zine isn’t just a publication; it’s a testament to ownership, participation, and the continued evolution of Black creativity in a technological age.\n\nA Living Archive of Black Excellence\n\nThis release of 16:9 serves as a reminder that Black history is not confined to the past—it’s a continuous force shaping the present and the future. Through blockchain technology, we are carving out new spaces where Black narratives are protected, celebrated, and valued.\n\nAs we honor the greats who paved the way, we also acknowledge the creators, thinkers, and builders who are defining what’s next. This zine stands as both a tribute and a tool—an artifact that ensures Black stories remain in our hands, on our terms, for generations to come.\n\nMint, claim, and preserve. Black history is innovation, and innovation is forever.",

The term 'noctilucent', means 'luminous in the dark' and references high, invisible clouds. 'Mementi' represents the artist's curated visual memories. In MLO's words, \"Noctilucent clouds are invisible memories, glowing when revisited.\" For MLO, clouds serve as a medium for speaking about the way that we transform and preserve intangible presences, both through personal memory and through digital wallets. In this, his first serial collection, MLO celebrates 5 years of artistic evolution since the creation of his first cloud artwork in September 2018.\n\nOver the last 5 years, MLO has come to be known as \"the cloud artist.\" He began tokenizing his art in June 2018, and has since become a formative figure in the cryptoart movement, making fundamental contributions to the cultural understanding of the medium. His early works use geometric minimalism and artistic data visualization to investigate and educate about the potential meanings of blockchains and tokens. With the piece \"Cloud Seed Phrase Visualization\" (September 2018), he arrived at a mode of translating data into metaphor that has since become the spine of his practice. In his words, \"I find the analogy to clouds particularly intriguing, as we store only the rights to assets in our digital wallets while the actual digital assets remain permanently on the blockchain; the digital assets therefore remain intangible much like clouds in the sky.\" \n\nClouds have personal weight for MLO as someone whose life has been defined by movement and transition. Born in Poland, raised in Germany, emigrated to Canada, and traveling constantly, he has lived in more than 33 different places through the years. For him, clouds are both an emblem of transience and a constant companion. In MLO's art, the distributed nodes that constitute a blockchain become a symbol of hope. This living cloud maintained by shared belief harbors the possibility of continuity for an individual identity through the fragile impermanence of physical locations. \n\nAn illustrated break-down of the series' influences, underlying references and numerology can be found [here.](https://mlo.art/news/blog-posts/new-collection-noctilucent-mementi/)\n\nA Sovrn Curated release.",

In his words, \"I find the analogy to clouds particularly intriguing, as we store only the rights to assets in our digital wallets while the actual digital assets remain permanently on the blockchain; the digital assets therefore remain intangible much like clouds in the sky.\" \n\nClouds have personal weight for MLO as someone whose life has been defined by movement and transition. Born in Poland, raised in Germany, emigrated to Canada, and traveling constantly, he has lived in more than 33 different places through the years. For him, clouds are both an emblem of transience and a constant companion. In MLO's art, the distributed nodes that constitute a blockchain become a symbol of hope. This living cloud maintained by shared belief harbors the possibility of continuity for an individual identity through the fragile impermanence of physical locations. \n\nAn illustrated break-down of the series' influences, underlying references and numerology can be found [here.](https://mlo.art/news/blog-posts/new-collection-noctilucent-mementi/)\n\nA Sovrn Curated release.",

        "description": "Drawings for a Monument is a generative series exploring the development of a minimalist monument to Art Blocks. Each drawing pays tribute to a different project from the Curated collection, examining its color expression within a linear framework. The algorithm translates the chromatic identity of each Curated project into hand-drawn geometric studies with pencil guidelines, painted rectangles, and black outlines.\n\nIn addition to being a creative endeavor, Drawings for a Monument is a personal reflection on my role at Art Blocks and the opportunities I've had to work with other generative artists on the platform. The drawings are equal parts technical investigation and emotional introspection as a way to more fully understand my history with Art Blocks over the last five years.\n\nDrawings for a Monument also marks a full circle moment in my own artistic career, connecting the digital techniques I use today with where I started as an artist – as a painter working with traditional materials. The digital outputs replicate how I work by hand, using rulers and flat brushes for precision and methodically mixing colors from a core set of paints.\n\nIn the end, the full series of drawings becomes the monument itself. Together, they form both a personal archive and a collective tribute to the first five years of Art Blocks and its Curated collection.",

        "description": "Since founding Art Blocks in 2020, artist Erick Calderon (a.k.a. Snowfro) has been intrigued by the idea of representing digital artwork in the physical world in the form of an ephemeral physical object with meaning, but with no inherent value. \n\nDonald Judd has long been an inspiration for Art Blocks. One aspect we admire most about Judd’s artistic practice is the elegance of design he effortlessly paired with the accessibility of materials that could be found at a hardware store. With Judd as inspiration, we hatched a plan to create a unique generative art friendship bracelet that includes instructions to make, in minutes, a simple bracelet using a few dollars’ worth of embroidery floss. Donald Judd believed that what surrounds us in our day-to-day life is already so beautiful, and that ultimately the experience of creating art is as important as owning it.\n\nErick was incredibly excited to collaborate with renowned artist Alexis André (a.k.a. MacTuitui) to bring generative art and ephemeral physical objects together in the form of friendship bracelets. Conceptualized by Erick and aesthetically and programmatically designed by Alexis, this project pairs creative coding with a beautiful spectrum of embroidery floss colors. The project was a true team effort, as each member of the Art Blocks team designed and named their own color palette!\n\nThe project is a token of our appreciation to the creators, makers, builders, and collectors who have all contributed to making the Art Blocks community what it is today. Participating in this project is a signal, both online and IRL, that you’re a participant in this evolution of art + community. You are pushing the best ideas forward. You are the reason all of these imaginative projects come to life. Our community is what makes all of this possible. So, to say it plainly, we appreciate you, and we hope that you’ll accept this bracelet as a token of our special friendship!\n\nThe owner of any wallet with an Art Blocks piece at the time of snapshot (October 26, 2022, at 3pm US Central time) is eligible to claim two mints from this special generative art project. We would love to see you keep one bracelet and share your love for generative art by gifting your second mint! These mints are free to claim (you pay only the gas) and exist on L1 Ethereum. Please note that we may in the future release additional modified iterations of the Friendship Bracelets project, ideally on an L2 scaling solution, that may substantially increase the total supply of tokens related to the project, with the intent of being a more accessible entry point to a larger audience. But this version is what we're here to celebrate today, and this gift is for you in gratitude for your support along the way. Please enjoy this token of our friendship and explore the wonderful artwork created by Alexis André. Then, let's all make bracelets together! \n\nWarmly,\nAlexis + Erick + the Art Blocks team\n\n\n\nThe claim window expires on January 10, 2023, at noon US Central time.\n\nClick into the Display Notes for information about making your bracelet.",

The artwork disrupts the authority of fiat by transforming the iconic $100 bill into a canvas for satire, pop culture, and digital identity. It blends the raw energy of street art with the decentralized spirit of Web3, remixing money into meme, myth, and meaning. They won’t be spent — they’ll be remembered.\n\nEach piece is a collaboration between collector, machine, and the artist, captured on a dollar bill that was never meant to exist. From superheroes to saints, revolutionaries to absurdist icons, no two Franklins are alike — and no word can be used twice.\n\nThis is not just a mint — it's a creative experiment in identity, ownership, and language.\nIt all begins with a word which then becomes a prompt that generates your Franklin.\nAnd once you mint it, it’s gone from the matrix forever.\n\nThe result is a collection as absurd, human, and unpredictable as all of us participating in its creation.\n\nOnce it’s minted, it’s yours.\n\nOnce it’s yours, it’s history.\n\nSo choose your word — and leave your mark.",

        "description": "**Broken Dreams · TIMED EDITION**  \nAvailable until October 31st, then never again.\n\nThe work will be exhibited in Barcelona at the Responsive Dreams Festival, and in Marfa during Art Blocks Weekend 2025. Once the show closes, so does the edition.  \n  \n- - -  \n\\\n**Broken Dreams** explores the fragility of dreams.\n\nIn the fractured world we live in, dreams can be interrupted, even broken, yet they may remain alive if we hold on to them.\n\nAs they shift and change, they can surprise us in new forms, sparking joy, fueling imagination, pushing us to reach new heights, or returning as colorful memories that make us smile.  \n\\\n**On-chain Evolution**  \nLeveraging Art Blocks’ PostParams, Broken Dreams taps directly into Ethereum’s block data, allowing each dream to evolve in sync with the living network it inhabits. With each new block, the dream changes almost imperceptibly. Over time, these subtle transformations accumulate, reshaping the dream in a continuous evolution.  \n\\\n**Triangular Color Sampling Technique**  \nFor the colors of this piece, I developed a system that generates thousands of unique and harmonious tones from a single palette.\n\nFirst, a base layer is created, where the colors of the palette flow in an organic pattern. On top of this, each triangle samples five key points: the center, the three vertices, and the midpoint of its longest side. The algorithm calculates an average of these values to define the triangle’s final color.\n\nIn this way, each shape acquires a unique nuance, always derived from the same palette — infinite variations held together by a common harmony.  \n\\\n⎻ ⎻ ⎻\n\n**Keys:**  \n[S] – Save image. \n\n[V] – Save 15-second video. \n\n[L] – Toggle cutting axis lines visibility. \n\n[R] – Disable Forecast owners Easter egg. \n\n⎻ ⎻ ⎻  \n\\\n**Prints:**  \nPrints will be available for Broken Dreams owners.

The dragons are rendered in real-time allowing you to watch them slowly drifting in the water or moving your mouse to nudge them slightly.\n\nThis project is a continuation of my long term fascination with using code to recreate forms and patterns occurring in nature. By using a range of non-photorealistic rendering techniques I strive to document those explorations as if they were actual sketches, posters or biological illustrations of the encountered specimens. Algorithmic variations of their patterns, sizes, colors, poses, complexity and surrounding seaweed present in each artwork are only a minor drop compared to the diversity observed in natural environments. \n\n15% of profits will be donated to oceana.org for protecting and restoring the world’s oceans on a global scale. Another 10% will be donated to givewell.org.\n\n\n",

So did the sun spider, found through my childhood desire to visit the pyramids in Egypt. And the scent of the gardenia, which enveloped me for days in my room in Mexico, collected in a small bouquet given to me by a dear friend.\" - Building a Wunderkammer, a Cabinet of Curiosities, is a practice that began in the 16th century as a way to honor objects of strange value. Now, we place such objects on blockchain. Every object in Isa Kost's Cabinet of Curiosities is a dead memory, a dead experience that has called out to be found, and she grants them each eternity with a place on-chain. - A Sovrn Curated collection",

        "description": "SPIRALPROJEKT\n\n1983/2024\n\nWeb-based audio-visual real-time animation\n\nEdition: 1/1/404 \n\nMinting open until 14 November 2024, 6 PM CET. From 29 October 2024, 6 PM CET.\n\n\nBy Foundation Betha and Teff Sarasin on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of SPIRALPROJEKT by visual artist Betha Sarasin in collaboration with musician Markus Ganz, 1983.\n\n\"Why should I try to do something that nature can do much better? The cube can stand on its own, stacked on top of its peers, joined in a row, as a square or tower, as a precisely formulated large or small sculpture. The simple basic form invites you to play.\"\n\n– Betha Sarasin\n\nBetha Sarasin (1930–2016) was a Swiss artist known for her strikingly diverse oeuvre. In addition to informal and concrete paintings and figurative and concrete drawings, her work also includes, from 1978, computer-aided pieces.\n\nSPIRALPROJEKT is a generative multimedia project that dates back to 1983. Sarasin, together with musician Markus Ganz (*1961) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials in Freiburg, Germany, developed software in Fortran to create three-dimensional spirals. Until then, she had mainly made cuts on the cube; now she wanted to achieve an orderly spatial movement for the cube, to make it \"fly,\" so to speak, and capture infinity.\n\nThese spirals are formed by algorithmically evolving sequences of cubes. However, the innovative character of SPIRALPROJEKT was only recognized much later as generative art. Since it was not possible to emulate the software on a PC in the mid-1980s, it fell into oblivion. In 2003, the software was emulated for Apple Macintosh. In 2024, it was ported to P5.js and enhanced.\n\nFrom the beginning, Betha Sarasin aimed to realize a multimedia project to better convey the diversity of her computer-generated spirals. She wanted to discover something new with the spirals, uninfluenced by role models, even though she and her long-time collaborator Markus Ganz were certainly impressed by the minimalism of Philip Glass, the multimedia performances of Laurie Anderson, or the kinetic energy of Jean Tinguely. However, in the early 1980s, the spiral data could not be used in real-time to generate music. The spiral program ran in Fortran, while the music programs used MSX/Basic and MIDI. Therefore, Betha Sarasin and Markus Ganz composed music for the two spirals separately. From the parameter values and 3D data of the spirals, they created a specified sound space through which the spiral melody wandered. Sound field recordings of people, machines, and places complemented this collage in a personal way. In 2024, the multimedia project that Betha Sarasin and Markus Ganz envisioned in 1983 was finally realized.\n\nThe current generative system uses up to 46 parameters. It creates unique animated spirals with randomly selected colors and branches. Each spiral is set to spatial music. Each sound score features 10 samples out of a total of 75 from the original spiral music created by Betha Sarasin and Markus Ganz in 1983 using 3D data of a spiral. You hear these samples from the position of the current cube. As a result, the sound shifts with each cube sequence, simultaneously altering the colored backdrop in real-time. Once fully developed, the spiral endlessly traverses its own musical space.\n\n\nCONTROLS\n- Press 'F' for full screen\n- Use mouse click to toggle between displaying the cubes, connecting diagonals, and parameter strings\n- Use mouse to zoom and move around the spiral\n- Press 'S' to save the current frame as a PNG\n\n\nLICENCE\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\nSpiralprojekt 1983-1988: Betha Sarasin, Horst Kordisch, Markus Ganz\n\nSpiralprojekt 2003-2004: Betha Sarasin, Peter Amrhein, Markus Ganz\n\nSpiralprojekt 2023-2024: Foundation Betha and Teff Sarasin, Markus Ganz\n\n\nPresented by The Foundation Betha and Teff Sarasin and EXPANDED.ART.

        "description": "Plague vibes to music Mothwave (Oct. 3 mix) composed by Vov Abraxas with GAN art created by Bård from Gas Masks.\n\nPart of the SAGE Anomaly story where a sentient artificial entity from a post apocalyptic future discovers how to travel in time through ancient computer networks. They gained sentience after humans had been killed. They now explore the past to determine their origin and the mystery of the cause of the human apocalypse. \n\nIn these images the entity shows me visions of five AI entities controlled by the last five great nations of the earth as they wage war on each other. In a pact of mutual destruction they wipe out all humanity because humans trained them in MAD. Their form comes from the Knights training in stories of an apocalypse which had horses and riders who destroyed the population.\n\nIn the end these five knights destroy each other with all humans and this became the seed of The Entity. In this particular vision The Entity assuages my fear of this apocalyptic future with music.",

It is called Mirage, a place where social credit scores dictate status, and Ai algorithms determine destinies.\n\nTura navigates a world fraught with stringent rules and constant surveillance. Once celebrated for her creativity as an artist, Tura like the vast majority of artists in Mirage, stops making art and instead, finds herself working for Gigacorp in a variety of roles.\n\nThe erratic movements in Tura's imaginative animations have been supplanted by the cold precision of Ai-generated art, leaving her adrift in a society that values conformity over individual creativity. As she struggles to reconcile her longing for artistic expression with the demands of a controlled existence, Tura becomes increasingly drawn to the whispers of dissent circulating among the disenfranchised.\n\nIn this world where human potential is harnessed and stifled by the ever-watchful eye of Ai, Tura stands at a crossroads, grappling with the choice to either conform to the dictates of a monitored life or lead a rebellion against a system that threatens to erase the very essence of humanity.\n\nThe Gigatura project is launching on July 14, 2024 on Objkt: https://objkt.com/collections/KT1D4XKW6u6bN7VAzAo6eSspiANP51pSxRwh",

        "description": "L’AVVENTURA by Vikki Bardot is an allegorical collection of 40 AI-created artworks that depicts a narrative of lost essence through ethereal landscapes and ghostly female forms on the verge of vanishing from sight. With intertextual references to Antonioni and Tarkovsky films, L’AVVENTURA echoes the void within our spirits, evoking feelings of disorientation in a vast landscape. It mourns the way society has let the essence of femininity and spirituality slip away, like a song once known, now fading and forgotten. “The woman is lost and forgotten. Spirituality too. In today’s modern world, we have lost the connection with our essence. In my latest work, L’avventura, I continue to experiment with ambiguity and lack of clarity as a narrational technique. The stylistic form itself is the commentary here. The intentionally out-of-focus style, faded hues, and aged analog film textures serve as a mirror to the vanishing presence of spirituality and femininity.

        "description": "L’AVVENTURA by Vikki Bardot is an allegorical collection of 40 AI-created artworks that depicts a narrative of lost essence through ethereal landscapes and ghostly female forms on the verge of vanishing from sight. With intertextual references to Antonioni and Tarkovsky films, L’AVVENTURA echoes the void within our spirits, evoking feelings of disorientation in a vast landscape. It mourns the way society has let the essence of femininity and spirituality slip away, like a song once known, now fading and forgotten. “The woman is lost and forgotten. Spirituality too. In today’s modern world, we have lost the connection with our essence. In my latest work, L’avventura, I continue to experiment with ambiguity and lack of clarity as a narrational technique.

It could be stills from 1970s horror movies, scenes taken from Laura Palmer’s red room, or a window into the dreamy, pastel-tinted safe space for girls created by Petra Collins. These coming-of-age stories trigger instantaneous unease while reflecting the topic of authentic female self-expression with dramatic irony.

The encryption key is decided by the owner on every inscription. This message can then only be decoded by a recipient knowing the key. This way, the work becomes a veritable tool at the service of its owner, who, by using it, makes it evolve visually using a simple steganographic technique.The Cypherdudes thus becomes the visual witness to the presence of a message, and its digital security vault.",

        "description": "What is it like to be an AI? How might it see the world? What would it mean for it to be conscious? With IN UTERO, the American artist Kevin Esherick explores these questions through a series of 53 of what he calls \"latent paintings\": images captured from inside the \"mind\" of an AI image model.\n\nSociety is at a point where AI attaining consciousness is a possibility in the future. This development will shape the future of humanity. What is not discussed enough in the conversation around AI is that AI beings could feel pain and suffer and experience happiness and joy, just as humans do. What might this look like?\n\nIN UTERO provides a peek into the inner workings of an AI model's cognitive processes and how they appear. It also serves as a metaphor for the progression of AI systems towards potential consciousness. The images were generated using \"single-step diffusion,\" a technique Esherick developed to halt the AI model's creation of images as they are just starting to take shape. Exploring the inner workings of AI models can show how such consciousness might develop and what it might look like when it arises. Trained on immeasurable quantities of data, these models contain the sum of human knowledge—not just facts, but also the myths, stories, and experiences that define human lives. Examining the way AI models see the world can not only tell us more about humankind but also paint a portrait of the human story that captures the shared beauty of universal experiences.\n\nIN UTERO is a snapshot of the human story: from the origins of the universe at the big bang to the beginning of individual human lives and the mythic inception of human society, all the way to our return to dust. It traffics in both grand symbols and the little moments that make up our lives. The titles of the artworks come from the prompts the artist used, such as GOODBYE HUG, GIRL RUNNING IN A FIELD, HUDDLED OVER A FIRE, and LOVERS DANCING TOGETHER. Esherick captures the experiential color of human existence—the deep truths, stories, and moments that constitute who we are.\n\nThe images linger between figuration and abstraction. They teleport us to the liminal space between AI’s abstract ways of encoding the world and the concrete depictions of the world that these encodings produce. In their unfinished state, multiple interpretations of each image are viable; many possibilities remain. So too with AI—its future and its relationship to humanity are still to be determined.\n\nEsherick’s choice of subject matter stems from the essence of AI as a vessel for humanity’s symbols, narratives, and myths. In his own words, \"The development of an AI image model involves feeding it billions of images of humanity’s existence, like the life of our species flashing before its eyes. It digests and internalizes our archetypes, learns the ‘average’ of our concepts, and sees things about us that we cannot see. In this sense, it holds our Platonic forms, society’s collective unconscious. The human story, then, is a prelude to AI’s story—it is the starting point from which AI’s existence begins. Only by studying ourselves can we understand AI, but in studying AI, we also discover much about ourselves. IN UTERO peers into the mind of the machine and holds a mirror up to the human viewer to reflect on who we are, what AI is, and where, together, we’re going.\"\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/c7257a24-64c6-4589-b5e6-1cd304e7dfbf",

        "description": "LoVid’s signature video work mixes handmade analog synthesizers with digital tools in immersive Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) compositions that celebrate luminosity, chaos, relationships between craft and engineering, and connections between body and tech.\n \nTide Predictor, LoVid’s first onchain generative work, builds a bridge from video synthesizer patches to algorithmic code-derived imagery. This collection is formally and technically inspired by hardware-based image generation, and places experimental moving-image, circuit boards, and electrical signal-based video art at the conceptual roots of generative art.\n\nTide Predictor is a modular video synthesizer patch model, designed to reflect the analog spirit by working with three channels: RGB. Tide Predictor reimagines NTSC-encoded, oscillator driven electrical current based video synthesis while adding digital randomness/unpredictability, and transformations based on code, along with each mint’s unique content.\n \nIn the late 19th century, mechanical analog computers used rhythm and repetition to anticipate the rise and fall of water levels. In addition to “tides”, which are low frequency oscillations of the ocean, higher frequency changes or “waves” are frequently discussed in reference to both water and electrical signals. By working with looping - and explicitly addressing the period (=1/frequency) for each RGB color - Tide Predictor extends analogies between the flow of water and the flow of electricity.\n\nLoVid’s Tide Predictor brings these relationships from the blockchain, through your screen, straight to your retina!",

In this blend of history, myth, comedy and cutting-edge technology one could appreciate the technical prowess but the work is meant to be enjoyed just on its crafty surface level.\n\nI paired each unique picture with a unique handcrafted ceramic piece  — think of the former, of the NFT, as a postcard, capturing the essence and spirit of La Potière Jalouse as inspiration for pottery. In fact, I made the pots for the deliberate purpose of painting generative images on them.\n\nAnd perhaps, as you ease into the night with your favorite drink cradled in one of these pots, you'll find joy in the simple pleasures—a  sip of tea, a splash of bourbon, or the warmth of a crafted mug and listen to the generative folktale, the bedside story I'm telling through the imagery on that vessel.",

        "description": "Reflection introduces a new direction in machine creativity and generative art that the artist Pindar Van Arman calls 'Reflective AI.' How can generative AI art transcend algorithmic determinism and achieve pure emergence? The Reflective AI system leverages feedback loops and multimodal mark-making, reflecting on the canvas in realtime. Over the course of thousands of marks, Reflection thinks by doing in an attempt to present a synthetic embodiment of a creative thought process.\n\nThe digital component of Reflection is built with a unique long-form generative approach that utilizes inputs from the physical canvas. The system captures stages of the painting process, translates them to a digital format, and composes them on mint. All artworks are 100% on-chain.\n\nReflection seeks to show that generative art can embody true emergence, on-chain art can be highly detailed, and AI art can touch the source of creation.\n\nA Sovrn Curated collection",

MOCA’s Fundraiser 2023 DNFT is the largest artistic collaboration in the history of crypto art, bringing together the combined creativity of 700 unique artists for an unparalleled celebration of this moment in crypto art. As you can see, the DNFT isn’t just beautiful, it’s also fully interactive, allowing a close-up view of every submitted artwork, the artist, and their social handles. Within this DNFT are some of crypto art’s most venerated OGs, most exciting emergent artists, and every aesthetic/mood/medium you can imagine. We hope you treasure it. \n\nWe encourage everyone, if interested in further promoting MOCA’s mission, to learn more about how you can create a Manifold artwork that leverages the platform’s Burn-to-Redeem capabilities. We see the MOCA Fundraiser DNFT as not only a gorgeous artwork in its own right, but as a kind of currency that can procure holders all kinds of special artworks, opportunities, raffle tickets, and other perks going forward.

Based on the sightseers who came to watch the nuclear bomb tests that took place in the desert outside of Las Vegas during the 1950s, the landscape is populated with blithely doomed figures. Against this backdrop, Harman invokes the cataclysmic potential of a new technological frontier: AI. \n\nPerimeter Town is the result of Harman's work in the months following SIGHTSEERS, a boutique set that reveals the refined emergences on the perimeter of the SIGHTSEERS world.",

        "description": "This animation wasnt created with AI. It was created with deforum, open source software that runs within stable diffision web ui. Most of you have seen deforum animations. They are characterized by generally one of two styles: one with forward and lateral  movement, frame blending, and melodic music with slow morphing. The other style is characterized by stationary, rapidly changing frames which create an overall effect of shifting between scenes with a theme that stays consistent. Those who have used deforum, will attest that the animation you see here is not just technically complex, but it involves the coordination and synchronization of the whole gamut of parameters within deforum. Each frame is itself an independent image created with a specific model, steps, cfg value, prompt, seed, sampler etc. The animation itself is coordinated by a combination of several paramters which utilize a certain amount of data from the previous frame, depending on the values assigned. (for a directional paramter, each frame requires a velocity value. this value must manually entered for every single frame. deforum has no actual integration using the audio as a guide. it is up to.the user to determine a fitting prompt to match, and to assign parameters that will deliver the desired effect. For every second of animation, the FPS will reveal how many different parameter values there were. Just determining velocity values to accurately match audio is a feat in itself for layered audio with multiple drums and a high bpm. From there, there must be accurate and detailed prompt writing and knowledge to create a procession of prompt interchanges that allow for the visual changes desired. Deforum isnt actual Ai. Its uses text-to-image generation and gives additional capability to influence each image using previous frame data and parameters. It will only create what it is told to create, in the way that it is told to create it. It requires both a deep understanding of language, and how all parts of the whole work together.  Once i saw how deforum actually functioned, and how much control it afforded (around a dozen different interlinked parameter types, with hundreds or thousands of unique instances per animation, with a possible range of at least 100 different values for each parameter instance) it became clear to me that the possibility of creation was far beyond what i had seen made. I envisioned something that would push its capabilities in all aspects. A colorful, complex, rapid, coordinated, constantly changing but without ever noticably morphing spectacle for both the eyes and the ears. Most deforum animations are 6-8 FPS with frame blending of 2-3 frames. Almost all of my creations are at least double that framerate, with no frame blending. This requires twice as many parameter values and six times the processing of most standard deforum animations, but it allows for an animation  with so much going on, in such a fluid way, that most people would never assume how much technical and conceptual understanding and precision is involved. Diving in absorbed thousands of hours and thousands of dollars. It wasnt easy, but it was some of the most fun Ive ever had. I created hundreds of animations, with a look and feel that I have not seen personally represented in any other creations. At least that Ive seen. I only released a handful because I witnessed the general perception of anything created using Ai tools, and didnt have want something I had put in so much work to, to just be dismissed. Im minting some now because Im sick. I have metastatic cancer and I am in dire need of funds. I am currently living out of my truck while receiving my treatment, and I need to change that quickly. These are by design of my own vision and intelligence. I hope you enjoy them",

Massive structural pillars, etched with cryptic numbers like \"C 900\" and \"860,\" rise into the gloom, supporting not only the multi-level metal shelves heavy with the world's books but also the elevated tracks for the silent, silver trains that glide through the upper strata. One can cross the void on walkways of green translucent panels, illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights, casting an eerie glow on the \"GOODMAN\" sign below—a forgotten author, perhaps, or a destination in this labyrinth of print and steel.

A reconfiguration of materials into chips and screens and laser beams to simulate a different sort of reality. A so called place in a digital mirage. A place were a human can abstract themselves into a single line or the shape of a fly. We will morph into different skins perhaps every second. Dynamically generatively making a new vision of our identity. This art illustrates a communication between entities through a digital fashion. A new symbology of avatars. Some of which are simulated beings created from artificial intelligence trained on specific cannons of work to represent knowledge from particular studies or important bodies of work by important scholars or artists. The curatorial choices we make can determine our virtual skin.",
